# Restful-Booker-API-Testing
API testing automation using the Restful Booker  API. The tests cover authentication and booking management CRUD operations.  Automation is achieved using JavaScript scripts (for dynamic token regeneration &amp; booking ID handling), executed via Newman, and integrated with Jenkins for CI/CD. Reports are generated in JUnit XML format.
