# Restful-Booker-API-Testing
API testing automation using the Restful Booker API.
The tests cover authentication, booking management, CRUD operations, and scripted assertions.
Automation is achieved using JavaScript scripts (for dynamic token regeneration, booking ID handling, and test validations), executed via Newman, and integrated with Jenkins for CI/CD. Reports are generated in JUnit XML format for easy Jenkins integration.
